A critically endangered (CR) species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. It is the highest risk category assigned by the IUCN Red List for wild species.

Endangered:-
An endangered species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species of animal or plant that is seriously at risk of extinction.

Vulnerable:-:-
A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve. Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species home.

Near Threatened:-
A near-threatened species is a species which has been categorized as "Near Threatened" (NT) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as that may be considered threatened with extinction in the near future, although it does not currently qualify for the threatened status.

A least concern (LC) species is a species which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as evaluated but not qualified for any other category. As such they do not qualify as threatened, near threatened, or (before 2001) conservation dependent.
